//support direct checks of output on a byte-by-byte basis.

print "Hello\nWorld"; //Expected: Hello
                      //Expected: World

print "\"Hello World\""; //Expected: "Hello World"

print "This is a backslash: \\";  //Expected: This is a backslash: \
print "This is not newline: \\n"; //Expected: This is not newline: \n
